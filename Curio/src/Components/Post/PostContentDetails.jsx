            <p className='post-details-content'>The twist here is that Im a U.S citizen but I have lived abroad for the past (around) 20 years.. my whole family returned from the US to home country when I was 8, I am 26 now so my whole education has been in my home country. My bf and I want to engaged before he goes to the US so we can get married after his masters. My question is, if we do decide to get married in the US after his masters and apply for his Adjustment of status there from F1 to green card, will his intent while entering the country on an f1 be questioned since he was already emgaged to a US citizen? Even considering the fact that I havent been to the US in almost 20 years so when we got engaged we expected that he would be coming back to the home country and we didnt intend to settle in the U.S at that point? What if we change our mind after he goes there?</p>
